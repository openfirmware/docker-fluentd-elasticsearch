# docker-fluentd-elasticsearch

Base docker image to run fluentd, with the ElasticSearch plugin.

The `latest` tag will use the latest version of `openfirmware/fluentd` and the latest version of fluentd-elasticsearch.

The `2.2.0` tag will lock fluentd td-agent to v2.2.0, and fluentd-elasticsearch to the latest version.

The `2.2.0-0.9.0` tag will lock fluentd td-agent to v2.2.0, and fluentd-elasticsearch to version 0.9.0.

## Building a tagged release from Github

As an alternative to the [Docker Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/), an image can be created from my Github repository:

    # docker build -t openfirmware/fluentd-elasticsearch github.com/openfirmware/docker-fluentd-elasticsearch.git

Once built, the image will be available locally as `openfirmware/fluentd-elasticsearch`. The command can be re-run to update the image with any changes to the Dockerfile.

## Running fluentd

Run the following command to start fluentd:

    # docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 24224:24224 openfirmware/fluentd-elasticsearch

By default, the plugin will assume these details for ElasticSearch:

    host: localhost
    port: 9200
    index_name: fluentd
    type_name: fluentd

These are almost certainly not useful unless you are using a different base image that includes ElasticSearch. Instead, customize the settings using environment variables as explained in the following sections.

## Running fluentd with a remote ElasticSearch host

With ElasticSearch running on `192.168.1.10` and port `9500`:

    # docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 24224:24224 -e ES_HOST="192.168.1.10" -e ES_PORT="9500" openfirmware/fluentd-elasticsearch

Environment Variables you can customize:

### ES_HOST

Host IP or address for ElasticSearch. Multiple hosts are not supported in this Dockerfile currently. Defaults to `$ELASTICSEARCH_PORT_9200_TCP_ADDR` then `localhost`.

### ES_PORT

Host port for ElasticSearch. Defaults to `$ELASTICSEARCH_PORT_9200_TCP_PORT` then `9200`.

### ES_INDEX

Index name for ElasticSearch. Defaults to `fluentd`.

### ES_TYPE

Type name for ElasticSearch. Defaults to `fluentd`.

## Running fluentd with a local container running ElasticSearch

Docker supports linking named containers together, allowing IPs and ports to be automatically configured from random values. Let's assume ElasticSearch is running in another docker container:

    # docker run -d --name=elasticsearch dockerfile/elasticsearch

That container has the name `elasticsearch` and has the ports 9200 and 9300 exposed but not bound. We can link it to `fluentd-elasticsearch`:

    # docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 24224:24224 --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch openfirmware/fluentd-elasticsearch

This will feed the IP and port from the `elasticsearch` container as default values instead of `localhost` and `9200`.
